# Next Steps Toward Containerization and Deployment

1. **Define Runtime Configuration**
   - Move secrets (Supabase, chatbot) to environment variables or a secrets manager.
   - Add a production configuration module (e.g., `config.py`) that reads env vars and disables Flask debug mode.
   - Document required variables in an example `.env` file.

2. **Add Persistence & Telemetry Stubs**
   - Implement a persistence layer for contact form submissions (Supabase or alternative queue).
   - Add structured logging (JSON) and request logging middleware to support observability when running in containers.

3. **Containerize the Application**
   - Write a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (builder + final slim image) and `.dockerignore`.
   - Expose the service on port 8000 and run with a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., `gunicorn`).
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` (optional) for local orchestration with dependencies.

4. **Introduce CI/CD Quality Gates**
   - Add automated tests or linting (e.g., `pytest`, `ruff`) and run them in GitHub Actions.
   - Include security scanning (Dependabot, Trivy) in the pipeline.

5. **Prepare for Kubernetes**
   - Create Kubernetes manifests or Helm chart covering Deployment, Service, ConfigMap/Secret, and HorizontalPodAutoscaler.
   - Define resource requests/limits and health probes (readiness/liveness) for reliability.
   - Plan for external ingress (Ingress controller) and TLS termination.

6. **Runtime Operations**
   - Configure centralized logging (ELK, Loki) and metrics (Prometheus exporters) before production rollout.
   - Set up alerting policies for availability and latency thresholds.

These steps will position the project for container-based delivery on Docker and Kubernetes while keeping security and reliability in focus.
